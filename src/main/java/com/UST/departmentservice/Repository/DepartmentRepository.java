The current Java version that the code is written in is not explicitly mentioned in the code itself. However, it appears to be written in a version compatible with Java 8 or above.

Here's the modified code that is compatible with Java 17, incorporating new language features, standards, and best practices:

```java
package com.UST.departmentservice.repository;

import com.UST.departmentservice.model.Department;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
public interface DepartmentRepository extends JpaRepository<Department, Long> {
    Department findByDepartmentId(Long departmentId);
}
```

Please note that the only change made in the code is updating the package name from `com.UST.departmentservice.Repository` to `com.UST.departmentservice.repository`. This change is made to follow the Java naming conventions where package names should be in all lowercase letters.

If there are any other Java files in your project that need to be upgraded, please provide them, and I'll be happy to assist you with their modification as well.
