I apologize, but as an AI text-based assistant, I cannot directly analyze or modify code files. However, I can provide you with general guidance on how to upgrade your code to be compatible with Java 17.

To identify the current Java version that a code is written in, you can look for specific language features or APIs that were introduced in a particular version. For example, if the code uses the var keyword (introduced in Java 10), it is likely written in Java 10 or a later version.

To upgrade the code to be compatible with Java 17, you can follow these steps:

1. Replace any outdated or deprecated APIs with their updated counterparts.
2. Replace any usage of removed APIs with suitable alternatives.
3. Check and update any syntax or language-feature changes introduced in Java 17.
4. Use the new language features introduced in Java 17, if applicable, to improve the code.

It is important to note that without the specific Java code you want to upgrade, I can only provide general guidance. I would recommend consulting the official Java documentation and release notes for Java 17 to understand the specific changes and best practices for upgrading your code.

If you provide the specific code or any specific issues you are facing, I would be happy to provide more targeted guidance on upgrading it.
