The given code snippet is not Java code. It appears to be a configuration file in YAML format. YAML is used for specifying data in a human-readable format and is often used for configuration purposes. As a result, it doesn't have any specific Java version associated with it.

To upgrade the code to be compatible with Java 17, we don't need to modify the given YAML configuration. Configuration files like this do not directly depend on Java version.

However, if you have any Java code that needs to be upgraded, please provide the relevant Java code, and I will be happy to assist you with upgrading it to Java 17.
