I'm sorry, but the code snippet you provided appears to be a configuration file for Spring Cloud Config and not Java code. Therefore, it cannot be upgraded to Java 17.

If you have any Java code that you would like to upgrade, please provide the relevant code snippet, and I'll be happy to assist you.
